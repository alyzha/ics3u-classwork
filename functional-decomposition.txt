# Functional Decomposition


# Vending machine (1)

## The vending machine gives a bag of chips (machine perspective)

- Display items, numbers, and prices
    - Give light
- Wait for a command
    - Have working buttons
- Recieve the money
    - Use light sensors to identify coins
    - Calculate the total recieved
- Process which slot to open and push the bag of chips out
- Refund the rest of the money if refund button is pushed

## Identify basic programming concepts from breakdown above

- Basic commands: - Recieve the money
- Nested structure: - Recieve the money
                        - Use light sensors to identify coins
                        - Calculate the total recieved
- Conditional branching: Refund the rest of the money "if" refund button is pushed


# The cookie is too big for the glass (2)

## How do you fix this problem?

    - Take the cookie out of the glass
    - Break off a piece so that it fits better
        - Hold on to two different sides and bend until the cookie breaks
    - Successfully dip it back into the cup
    
## How can you prevent this problem?

    - Get a larger cup, or, get a smaller cookie
    
## How can this problem be solved with an app?

    - Create an app that can keep track of your cup and cookie sizes
        - It must have a database of default cookie diameters (ie. Oreos and Chips Ahoy)
        - Or, a numerical input that the user can type in after measuring their own cookie
    - Input your cup measurments 
        - Measure out all the diameters of your own cups
        - Label each cup (or type of cup) and associate it with the witdh
    - Have the app recieve cookie size and show you which cups it will fit in
   

# The spoon dropped into the gravy (3)

## How do you fix this problem?

    - Grab a pair of chopsticks
        - Find one in your kitchen, or, go out and buy one
    - Use said pair of chopsticks to pinch the spoon handle
    - Lift spoon out of gravy
    - Wipe or rinse off the spoon
        - Hold it under running water
        - Use a tissue to wipe
        
## How can you prevent this problem?

    - Use a soup spoon with the hooked handle
    - very carefully balance the spoon (works better flipped over, concave side down)
    - If all else fails, simply keep spoon out of gravy
    
## How can this problem be solved with a robotic system?

    - Create an arm robot
        - It must have carrying capabilities
    - Place robot on your table
    - Give the spoon to robot each time after use
        - The robot holds the spoon for you
    

# People hogging seats with bags (4)

## How do you fix this problem?

    - Fake a leg injury and stand in full view of the bag owner
    - "If" they do not notice you, ask politely for them to move their bags
        - Starting with "excuse me, would you mind moving your bag"
        
## How do you prevent this problem?

    - Establish a law in which taking up seat spaces with your luggage is illegal
        - Get a position in Parliment
        - Convince everybody to pass this new law
    - Now, you may fine people who hog seats, and so, within years this will cease to exist prominently
    
## How can this problem be solved with a technological solution?

    - Make seats that are able to detect whether or not a person is there
        - Put in heat detectors
    - Make the seat bottom retractable
        - If there is no person sitting there, the seat will retract and just consist of the backboard
        - If a person approaches close enough, the seat will remain in place
